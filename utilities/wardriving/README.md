# Wardriving Merge Scripts

Small helpers that merge multiple wardriving CSV logs into a single output file.
Use this when you have many capture files and want one consolidated dataset for upload or analysis.

## Contents

- `wardriving-merge.py` (Python)
- `wardriving-merger.ps1` (PowerShell)
- `wardriving-merger.sh` (Bash)

## Typical workflow

1. Copy one of the scripts into the folder that contains your CSV files.
2. Run the script.
3. It will create `final-wardrive-merged.csv` in the same folder.

See the script you choose for any options or platform notes.
